<p>Below is an in-depth explanation of the AArch64 (ARM64)
unconditional branch instruction—often simply called the
“B” instruction—and how its 26‐bit immediate field (imm26)
is laid out and later relocated during linking.</p>
<hr></hr>
<h2>Instruction Layout</h2>
<p>The unconditional branch in AArch64 is encoded in a 32‑bit
instruction. Its layout is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>Bits:  31         26 25                           0
        +-------------+------------------------------+
        |  Opcode     |          imm26               |
        +-------------+------------------------------+
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opcode (bits 31:26):</strong></li>
<li>For a plain branch (<code>B</code>), the opcode is <code>000101</code>.</li>
<li>
<p>For a branch with link (<code>BL</code>), which saves the return
address (i.e., a call), the opcode is <code>100101</code>.
These 6 bits determine the instruction type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Immediate Field (imm26, bits 25:0):</strong></p>
</li>
<li>This 26‑bit field holds a signed immediate value.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Offset Calculation:</strong> At runtime, the processor:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shifts</strong> the 26‑bit immediate left by 2 bits.
(Because instructions are 4-byte aligned,
the two least-significant bits are always zero.)</li>
<li><strong>Sign-extends</strong> the resulting 28‑bit value to
the full register width (typically 64 bits).</li>
<li><strong>Adds</strong> this value to the program counter
(PC) to obtain the branch target.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reach:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>With a 26‑bit signed field that’s effectively 28 bits
  after the shift, the branch can cover a range
  of approximately ±128 MB from the current instruction.</li>
</ul>
